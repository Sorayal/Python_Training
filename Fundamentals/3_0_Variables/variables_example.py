# named memory address that keeps values
# in Python you don´t need to predefine a datatype
# It´s dynamically typed language that means the necessary
# datatype will be determined by the Python Virtual Machine
# during runtime

# String variable
flower = "rose"
greeting = "Hello Universe"
greeting = greeting.split(" ")[0]
print(greeting)

# Integers
number_one = 1
number_two = 2
print(number_one + number_two)

# Boolean
check = True
print(check)
