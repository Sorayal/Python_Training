# Integer arithmetic
# A simple expression

# Write a program that takes 3 integer numbers a, b and c, calculates a times b and then subtracts c from the product. The program should print the result.

# There's no need to create the variables, just use them in the code below.

# Sample Input 1:

# 8
# 11
# 63
# Sample Output 1:

# 25

# work with these variables
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
print(a * b - c)
