# Hello, world!

# The classical introductory exercise, slightly modified. Write a program that takes a string, writes it to the variable name (this part of code is already written for you), and then prints "Hello, world! Hello, name". Note that there's a space before the name.

# The variable name is already defined.

# Hint

#  Report a typo
# Sample Input 1:

# John
# Sample Output 1:

# Hello, world! Hello, John

name = input()
print(f"Hello, world! Hello, {name}")
